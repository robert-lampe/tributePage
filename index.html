      <li>John Whiteside "Jack" Parsons (born Marvel Whiteside Parsons;
        October 2, 1914 â€“ June 17, 1952)
        was an American rocket engineer and rocket propulsion researcher,
        chemist, and Thelemite occultist.
        Associated with the California Institute of Technology (Caltech),
        Parsons was one of the principal founders of both the
        Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Aerojet Engineering Corporation.
        He invented the first rocket engine to use a castable,
        composite rocket propellant, and pioneered the advancement of both
        liquid-fuel and solid-fuel rockets.</li><br>

      <li>After a brief involvement with Marxism in 1939, Parsons converted
        to Thelema, the English occultist Aleister Crowley's new religious
        movement. In 1941, alongside his first wife Helen Northrup,
        Parsons joined the Agape Lodge, the Californian branch of the
        Thelemite Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.). At Crowley's bidding,
        he replaced Wilfred Talbot Smith as its leader in 1942 and ran
        the Lodge from his mansion on Orange Grove Avenue (dubbed The Parsonage).
        Parsons was expelled from JPL and Aerojet in 1944 due to the Lodge's infamous
        reputation, along with his hazardous workplace conduct.</li><br>

      <li>Science fiction writer and U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard
        soon moved into the Parsonage; he and Parsons became close friends.
        Parsons wrote to Crowley that although Hubbard had "no formal
        training in Magick he has an extraordinary amount of
        experience and understanding in the field. From some of his
        experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher
        intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. ... He is the most
        Thelemic person I have ever met and is in complete accord with
        our own principles."<br><br>
